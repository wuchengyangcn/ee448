# Sentiment Analysis & Graph Mining Based on Big Data
+ text_classification: Learned the article selection behaviour of editors to propose a classification model for recommending selected news. Trained a *Convolutional Neural Network* classifier to assign text documents to predefined categories and automatically select a subset of candidates from a large pool for online news aggregators to push to their users
+ link_prediction: Analyzed data in a *Knowledge Graph8 for solving *Link Prediction* problems concerning *Academic Networks*. Proposed a knowledge representation model based on *Deep Walk* for studying triplets of fact (head entity, relation, tail entity) and inferring missing links in an observed academic knowledge graph. Original data is extracted and transferred from [Acemap Knowledge Graph](https://acemap.info/app/AceKG)
